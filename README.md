Utilities for automatic documentation of my thesys acording to IEC 61802
===============================================================================

I stored the structured information of my thesis models in a XML standarized way. When the information 
is stored in a presentation independent format, this information can be accesed in 
different views and formats when required. 

I manipulate my informations using python to generate automatically latex scripts that render my information in tables. 

This is the workflow:

My system information model -> My Python scripts -> automatic generated latex scripts -> automatic generated and pretty readable pdf document
